if N even reduce to N-1.
N=2K+1. i know at least K+1 are good.
im allowed 2N-2=4K questions.
i ask (1,2),...,(2K-1,2K)
***so far K questions.
i get T answers of "good". i then ask the second about the first in each such case.
***so far K+T questions.
out of those T questions, i get S answers of "good". each such pair is either both good or both bad.

A. if S=0 then i know last person good.
	so i ask him about the rest 2K people
	***so far K+T+2K<=4K questions.
B. if S odd then i know there is a majority in the S pairs of good pairs. otherwise majority of bad guys.
	so i recursively do them. it takes me 2S-2 questions to figure them out.
	***so far K+T+2S-2 questions.
	i now take a good guy and ask them about all the 2K+1-2S people.
	***so far K+T+2S-2+2K+1-2S=3K+T-1<4K questions.
C. if S is even then i take one person from each of the S pairs, with the last person.
	all in all S+1 people, an odd number, and it cannot be that the majority are bad. so the majority are good.
	so it takes 2S questions to figure them out.
	***so far K+T+2S questions.
	now it remains to figure out the rest. 2K-2S questions.
	***so far 3K+T<=4K questions.
done!
